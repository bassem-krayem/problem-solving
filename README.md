# problem-solving
This is a repository where I practice problem solving from different platforms. Each solution is commented to explain my thought process, and often includes alternative or improved approaches when available.

# 🧠 Problem Solving Practice

Welcome to my problem-solving repository! This is where I practice coding challenges from different platforms to improve my logical thinking, algorithmic skills, and familiarity with JavaScript.

## 📁 Structure

Inside the repository, you’ll find a separate directory for each platform I work on (e.g., Codeforces, LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.). Each directory contains the problems I’ve solved from that platform.

Example:
 
/leetCode/
reverseInteger.js
/codeforces/
sumOfDigits.js
## 🗒️ What You’ll Find in Each File

Every file in this repository is self-documented with comments, so you can easily follow along:

- 🔹 **Problem Description**  
  At the top of each file, I briefly describe what the challenge is asking.

- 🔹 **My Approach**  
  I explain how I personally solved the problem, including the tools and logic I used.

- 🔹 **Alternative Solutions (if any)**  
  If I find a more efficient or math-based approach (either from research or other users), I also include that with an explanation.

- 🔹 **Clean, Beginner-Friendly Code**  
  This repo is especially useful for beginners looking to learn how to solve problems step-by-step, with explanations along the way.

## 🧭 Why This Repo Exists

- To track my growth as I improve in coding challenges.
- To serve as a learning resource for others.
- To prepare for technical interviews and real-world problem solving.

## 🙌 Contributions
